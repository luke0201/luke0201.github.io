# Personal Blog

Yes, this is my personal blog.

Here are guidelines and references for writing articles.

## Game Screenshot

Press *Windows* + *Print Screen* keys to capture the entire screen. The image will save to *Pictures\Screenshots*
folder.

Transfer the screenshots to your Mac PC. I use Google Drive for this purpose.

Each image is a 1920x1080 PNG file. Its file size is around 3MB, too big to be embedded in an article. You need to
reduce the file size. Downscale and convert it into WebP format using *convert-screenshots.sh* script.

```shell
./convert-screenshots.sh ${DIRECTORY}
```

The output image would be smaller than 100KB. Even mobile viewers won't be a problem now!
